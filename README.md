# Projects

Sadly My use of Get Hub has been super spotty so there is not much of a history to these projects or there version control.

Chat4Me : Android Studio
An Android App that uses AI to create automatic text responses using your chat history to mimic you texting style. was a 3 Month Project made with a team, but sadly the repo got deleted though I managed to save a copy on my laptop.

Calculator : C++
super simple calculator made with a focus on creating tests for our code before writing the code itself to help catch problems early.

Function Pointer : C
Classic C programing which is my least favorite programing language. wanted to add something with this here to prove that even using my worst language I can still make good projects. 

Airport Manager : Java
Favorite project in my favorite language I have done. though ended up becoming extra credit due to having a large scope for a 2 week project. I did my half of the work though my partner didn't do there's before the project was canceled so all the work is mine and though it is half done I'm still proud of the work.

Santa : Java
A personal project that took about 3 hours. it takes a list of names and will create a lift of who is giving what present to how for Secret Santa.

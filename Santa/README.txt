A simple family Secret Santa divider made for Christmas when our extended family gets together and dose a inter family Secret Santa. this code Guarantees that you wont have family's draw themself or people from there own family. Each new line denotes a different family. made this in 3 hours so its not the greatest quality. I know I can use some better programing techniques in order to smooth out the process and make it so that the program dose not have to reset itself, but it works. Also yes I did change the names.
